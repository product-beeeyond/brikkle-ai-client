# Brikkle Knowledge Base: Complete User Guide and Reference

## What is Brikkle?

### Platform Overview
Brikkle is Nigeria's first blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that democratizes property ownership through tokenization on the Stellar network. We enable Nigerians both at home and in the diaspora to invest in premium Nigerian real estate starting from just $5 (₦8,000), earning daily rental income and property appreciation without the traditional barriers of high capital requirements, complex documentation, or property management responsibilities.

### Core Value Proposition
**Access**: Invest in Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt properties with a $5 minimum investment, compared to traditional ₦8-50 million property purchases. **Returns**: Earn 8-15% annual returns through automated daily rental distributions plus property appreciation. **Transparency**: Every transaction recorded on Stellar blockchain with real-time property performance tracking. **Professional Management**: Properties managed by vetted Nigerian property management companies with IoT monitoring systems.

### How Brikkle Works
Properties are tokenized as Stellar assets representing fractional ownership. Each property token gives you proportional rights to rental income and appreciation. Tokens are tradeable 24/7 on Brikkle's integrated AMM marketplace, providing instant liquidity. Smart contracts automate rent collection and distribution, eliminating traditional property management complexities.

### Market Opportunity
Nigeria faces a 22+ million housing unit deficit while property prices have grown 39.5% in Lagos alone. Our platform addresses this by enabling fractional investment in income-generating properties, targeting the 90% of aspiring Nigerian property investors currently excluded from the market due to high barriers.

## Getting Started with Brikkle

### Account Creation and Verification

**Step 1: Registration**
Create your Brikkle account at app.brikkle.ai using your email address and phone number. Nigerian residents provide National Identity Number (NIN) and Bank Verification Number (BVN). Diaspora investors provide passport and proof of overseas residence.

**Step 2: Identity Verification (KYC)**
Upload required documents for compliance with CBN and SEC regulations. **For Nigerians**: NIN slip, valid ID, proof of address, BVN verification. **For Diaspora**: International passport, overseas address proof, source of funds declaration, tax identification from country of residence. Verification typically completes within 24-48 hours.

**Step 3: Payment Setup**
Link your preferred payment method. **Nigerian residents**: Bank account, card payments, USSD transfers. **Diaspora investors**: International wire transfer, stablecoins (USDC, USDT), major cryptocurrencies through our Stellar wallet integration. All payments converted to USD-pegged stablecoins for property investment.

### Understanding Fractional Ownership

**Tokenization Explained**
Each property is divided into tokens representing fractional ownership. Example: ₦100 million Lagos property = 100,000 tokens at ₦1,000 each. Your 100-token investment gives you 0.1% ownership, entitling you to 0.1% of rental income and appreciation.

**Investment Minimums**
- **Absolute minimum**: $5 per property investment
- **Practical minimum**: $50-100 for meaningful diversification
- **No maximum limits**: Invest up to 10% of total property tokens
- **Portfolio building**: Spread investments across multiple properties

### Property Due Diligence

**Property Information Available**
Each property listing includes: professional valuation by certified Nigerian valuers, high-resolution photos and virtual tours, rental history and projected yields, legal documentation (Certificate of Occupancy, survey plans), property management company profile, neighborhood analysis with infrastructure scores, and environmental impact assessments.

**Verification Standards**
All properties undergo rigorous due diligence: title verification through Lagos State Government blockchain registry (where available), structural assessments by licensed engineers, market analysis by certified valuers, legal review by SEC-registered law firms, and property management company accreditation.

**Document Access**
Property documents stored on IPFS with blockchain hash verification. Access original Certificates of Occupancy, building approvals, survey documents, insurance policies, and property management agreements. All documents digitally signed and timestamped.

### Making Your First Investment

**Browse Properties**
Use filters to find properties matching your criteria: location (Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt), property type (apartments, offices, mixed-use), price range, expected yield, and risk profile. Sort by popularity, yield, or recent performance.

**Investment Process**
Select property → Choose investment amount → Review transaction details → Confirm payment → Receive tokens instantly in your Brikkle wallet. Tokens appear immediately with full ownership rights activated.

**Diversification Strategy**
Recommended portfolio allocation: 40% Lagos properties (highest growth), 30% Abuja (stable government demand), 20% Port Harcourt (oil sector), 10% emerging markets. Diversify across property types: residential (steady income), commercial (higher yields), mixed-use (balanced returns).

Token holders vote on major property decisions: property manager changes (requires 60% approval), capital improvements above ₦5 million, refinancing decisions, and property sale authorization. Voting power proportional to token ownership.

**Exit Mechanisms**

## Earning Returns and Income Distribution

### Daily Rental Income Distribution

**Automated Collection System**
Property management companies collect rent from tenants → funds deposited to property SPV account → smart contract distributes proportional shares to token holders → income appears in Brikkle wallets within 24 hours. All transactions recorded on Stellar blockchain for transparency.

**Distribution Frequency**
Daily distributions for properties with regular rental income. Weekly distributions for short-let properties with variable occupancy. Monthly distributions for commercial properties with quarterly rent payments. Special distributions for one-time income (security deposits, late fees).

**Currency and Conversion**
Rental income collected in Naira, converted to USD stablecoins for distribution. Exchange rates locked at collection time protecting against currency volatility. Option to receive distributions in Naira for Nigerian residents or maintain stablecoin exposure.

**Yield Calculations**
**Net Rental Yield** = (Annual rent income - management fees - taxes) / property value. **Cash-on-Cash Return** = Annual cash flow / invested amount. **Total Return** = Rental yield + appreciation. Historical yields: Lagos residential 6-8%, Abuja government area 5-7%, Port Harcourt commercial 8-12%.

### Property Appreciation and Valuation

**Monthly Valuation Updates**
Professional valuations performed monthly by certified Nigerian valuers using comparable sales, income approach, and replacement cost methods. Valuations incorporate recent sales data, market trends, infrastructure developments, and macro-economic factors.

**Appreciation Tracking**
Token values updated monthly reflecting property appreciation. Example: ₦100M property appreciates to ₦110M = 10% token value increase. Appreciation compounds over time with market performance. Historical appreciation: Lagos 15-25% annually, Abuja 8-12%, emerging markets 20%+.

**Market Data Sources**
Valuation inputs from multiple sources: Nigeria Bureau of Statistics housing data, Central Bank real estate indices, private property portals (PropertyPro, Estate Intel), developer transaction data, and on-ground market surveys by local partners.

### Tax Implications and Optimization

**Diaspora Tax Considerations**
**US Investors**: Rental income reportable as foreign income, potential Foreign Tax Credit for Nigerian taxes. **UK Investors**: Rental income subject to UK tax rates, mortgage interest relief may apply. **Double Taxation Treaties**: Available for US, UK, limited coverage for other countries. **Professional advice strongly recommended**.

**Tax Documentation**
Automated tax reporting for token holders. **Nigerian investors**: Pre-filled tax forms with income summaries. **Diaspora investors**: Foreign income statements for home country tax filing. **Detailed records**: All transactions, distributions, and appreciation tracked for audit purposes.
